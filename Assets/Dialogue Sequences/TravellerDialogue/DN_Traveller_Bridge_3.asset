    sentences:
    - The ruins beneath are fascinating aren't they? For such a long-forgotten place
      it's brimming with life and danger to boot
    - Have you seen them? Those sad men made out of wood... I wonder what they did
      to deserve such a sad fate
    - I heard these roads used to lead to a temple beneath the earth... maybe the
      answer is buried there
